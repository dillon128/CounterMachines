# CounterMachines

Slides.txt contains some slides explaining counter machines and the busy beaver problem. It includes my personal bests for the busy beaver problem.

CounterMachines.txt contains the text of the code that can be copied into https://sagecell.sagemath.org/

Partial_Solutions.txt contains programmes for calculating addition, multiplication, and powers of two, as well as a programme to sort two numbers into increasing order, and my personal best programmes for the busy beaver problem. Be aware that BB_17 runs for 17,433,922,066 steps before halting! If you don't want the code to output the content of the registers after every step, then comment out the print (Count, Registers) line of code by putting a # before that line.
